<p> I am a PhD student at the London School of Economics and Political Science in the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/">Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method</a>. My research interests lie in epistemology and the philosophy of science, with a special focus on modelling under uncertainty, robustness analysis and climate science. I am also interested in foundational issues in the philosophy of statistics.</p>

   <div class="hidden-box"> <p> I critically assess an argument put forward by Kuorikoski et al. (2010) for the epistemic import of model-based robustness analysis. I show that this argument is not sound since the sort of probabilistic independence on which it relies is unfeasible. By revising the notion of probabilistic independence imposed on the models' results, I introduce a prima-facie more plausible argument. However, despite this prima-facie plausibility, I show that even this new argument is unsound in most if not all cases of model-based robustness analysis. This I do to demonstrate that the epistemic import of model-based robust analysis cannot be satisfactorily defended on the basis of probabilistic independence.</p>

   <div class="hidden-box"> <p> In science, obtaining a "robust" result is often seen as providing further support for a hypothesis. The Bayesian should have something to say about the logic underpinning this method of confirmation. Schupbach's recent explanatory account (2018) of robustness analysis (RA) is a welcome attempt to do so. Indeed, by having 'as its central notions explanation and elimination' (ibid., 286), this account seems to fit very nicely with many empirically driven cases of RA in science, thereby revealing why these cases are able to lend confirmation to a hypothesis. The subject of my paper, however, is Schupbach's further claim that his account of RA 'applies to model-based RAs just as well as it does to empirically driven RAs' (ibid. 297), since when we arrive at this claim, he and I decisively part ways. I argue that the application of Schupbach's account to model-based RAs is considerably more complicated than he and others (such as Winsberg (2018)) suggest and relies on several non-trivial and often dubious assumptions.</p>

   <div class="hidden-box"> <p> The aim of this paper is to offer a thorough diagnosis of some of the conceptual problems currently faced by the IPCC uncertainty framework. I believe that any successful attempt to revise and improve the framework will have to start from a clear understanding of the current conceptual problems, their implications for the IPCC authors' treatment of uncertainties, and the quality of the information provided in the AR5. Accordingly, this paper is an attempt to contribute to this first step. I begin by showing that there is no interpretation of 'confidence' and 'likelihood' that is compatible with the IPCC uncertainty guide's recommendations and thus with the resulting practice of the IPCC authors in their communication of uncertainty. I argue that the lack of a conceptually valid interpretation of 'likelihood' and 'confidence' has worrying implications for both the practice of the IPCC authors in their treatment of uncertainties and the quality of the information provided in the AR5. Finally, I show that an understanding of the reasons behind the decision to include two uncertainty scales in the AR4 uncertainty framework can give us some insights into the nature of this problem.</p>

<h2>Short Bio</h2>

<table class="table table-responsive table-condensed" style="background-color:#f3e7f0">

<tr><td>
<p> Before getting into philosophy I studied mathematics at the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/">University of Warwick</a> (with the intention to keep studying it, but I clearly changed my mind at some point). One of my regrets is not to have realised earlier how interesting statistics can really be. </p>
